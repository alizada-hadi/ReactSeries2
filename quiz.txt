1- what is a React component
	Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, 
2- What's wrong with this bit of code ?
```
function myComponents(){
	return(
		<small>this is a simple component</small>
	)
}
```
Our component's name should start with capital letter and also should be named camel case	
3- What is wrong with this code?
```
function Header(){
	return(
		<header>
			<nav>
			<img src="" />
			</nav>
		</header>
	)
}
ReactDOM.render(Header(), docu....)

```	
	the problem is passing it in the react-dom method it should be pass like <Header />
